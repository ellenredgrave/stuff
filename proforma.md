# Computing 2 Submission Proforma

**CID:** 01735544

For each section, write a maximum of 200 words.

## Brief
*State what you set out to acomplish with this web app.*
The webapp aims to help people who have specific food requirements to find restaurants in their area that cater to their needs.
The webapp lets the user enter their location and dietary requirement and then lists the restaurants in that area that are in the database, as well as the number of items on the menu that fit the dietary requirement, and the rating given by users. The user can then view reviews and comments and add their own review by clicking on the restaurant name and providing a comment and rating out of 5.

## Coding
*Highlight your approach to coding in this project.*
I split the coding up into different sections, first creating a base HTML file for each page, outlining what was wanted on each page. A base CSS file was created for the entire page. Next the server was created and in conjunction with a javascript file for each page, I CODED. Using SQL manager, I created a database 
produced a back-end server that recieves form info and creates unique pages based on form. Also updates and pulls from SQL database.

## UX/UI
*Outline the key elements of your UX/UI design.*
Made it clear on each page what was happening and how to use webapp.

Reviews automatically update when submitted
More than two users can use website and see each other's reviews.

## Data
*Explain how you structure and process your data.*
The code reads and writes to an SQL database and uses joins to get information. Webapp pulls specific data based off the form submissions and what is clicked on.
